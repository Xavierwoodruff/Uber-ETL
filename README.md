<h1>Uber KPI Dashboard (SQL + Power BI)</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>

This project utilized PostgreSQL, Power BI, and raw Uber data to answer any possible Management or Stackholder questions. 

I began by designing and building a PostgreSQL database to store and manage the dataset. Once the data was imported, I performed data cleaning by removing unnecessary columns, correcting inconsistencies, currency conversions and preparing the dataset for analysis.

Next, I wrote a SQL query using a Common Table Expression (CTE) to aggregate and extract all relevant information needed for my analysis, and I created a view to streamline the connection to Power BI.

In Power BI, I connected to the view and developed an interactive dashboard with visualizations that allowed for patterns and trends to be identified and answer Mangement or Stackholder questions.
